## MOID

Compute the MOID - Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance for two given confocal, elliptical orbits.
It uses the idea of rotating meridional plane and calculates the MOIDs numerically.

This Julia module is a wrapper to the Fortran program by the original authors Hans Rickman  and Tomasz Wiśniowski, both
Space Research Centre, Polish Academy of Sciences.

The method is described in their paper:

T.Wiśniowski and H.Rickman, “A Fast, Geometric Method for Calculating Accurate Minimum Orbit Intersection Distances (MOIDs)” 2013 Acta Astronomica

The paper and the source code are provided here in the deps and doc subdirs.
